## Introduction
This Milestone project is the second of four that continues to contribute towards my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute. The main requirements in this project are to design an Interactive front-end website that responds to users’ actions, allowing users to actively engage on the website with purposeful decisions made which will alter the way the site displays the information and ultimately achieve the users’ goals. The main technologies that need to be used to achieve this is HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the option of using jQuery, other JavaScript libraries and external APIs.

The Euro Football Quiz is an interactive website that gives users that have an interest in International Football some useful information about the UEFA European Championships going back over 60 years. I decided to design this website based on my own interests of international football and to tie in with the latest Euro tournament that is due to start on the 11th June 2021 (Originally scheduled in June 2020, but delay due the Covid-19 Pandemic).   

The site will have four webpages and a fifth hidden page for answers to the quiz. The four main web pages will be the homepage, tournament page, quiz page and feedback page. Users will enjoy the site as it will offer information about all Euro championships played from hosts, winners and interesting facts. The site will offer a general knowledge quiz about the Euro Championships and a feedback page.  

Date this project started: 3rd June 2020

## User Stories 

1. I am an England Football fan. I have always followed England since I starting watching football as a young boy in the early 1980’s. I would like to know more about the tournament going back before I was born to get a better understanding of who hosted and who won the tournament. 

1. I’m a sports enthusiast and always enjoy being challenged when it comes to football knowledge.  

1. I’m part of a weekly pub quiz team. I would like to know more about international football and gain more general knowledge to improve my contribution when I'm with my pub quiz team. 

1. I like taking my children to sports events and would like to know whether this football tournament is due to be hosted at some point soon that's close enough to travel to and attend a couple of games.  

1. I’m from America and have little knowledge of Soccer (football). The sports I played at school and watch now are mainly Baseball and Basketball. My wife is from France and says that Football is the best sport on the planet. I would like to find out more about the tournaments connected with this sport and find out if football is the biggest and best sport on the planet as my Wife says.

## Development Process 

### Strategy Plane

* With the Euro Championships starting on the 11th June 2021, I knew I wanted to create a website to celebrate this tournament with it being a 60-year anniversary. I already have good knowledge of the sport and this tournament in particular, and therefore I wanted to showcase the history and success of this sporting event whilst giving all users a chance to answer some questions about it in a form of multiple-choice. The user stories created above kept me focused on what the website should look like and offer. I therefore complete a trade-off between importance and viability/feasibility based on key areas I would like the website to have.

### Scope Plane

* As I refined the features of the website, I knew I wanted to offer users some good knowledge of this football tournament and offer the option to interact with answering some multiple-choice questions. I wanted to make sure that I got the chance to showcase JavaScript and therefore I decided that the quiz page, markers on a google map and a feedback form would successful achieve this. I also decided to add a vertical timeline which would highlight key milestones of the tournament which I believe would look appealing and interesting to users.

### Structure Plane

* I wanted to keep the Structure straightforward so that all users visiting the site would see the same theme and layout making their experience on the site enjoyable and easy to navigate around. The homepage would have minimum content with a strong ‘hero’ image of what the site is about with a brief welcome message, timeline of milestone events relating to the football tournament and then options to click on. The options the user would have to move on to would be the tournament page giving lots of information about the history of the tournament, countries that hosted it, countries that won it and future confirmed Euro tournament events to look forward to. Other options for the user would be to click on the quiz page to answer multiple-choice questions and finally a feedback form page for users to complete. The quiz page would also generate a score based on how many questions the user gets right once submitted. The user can then try again, click on the answers page or navigate back to the homepage or tournament page via the navigation bar at the top. The answers page would be available to view only when the quiz page was submitted after all questions were answered correctly or incorrectly. 

* The below spreadsheet gave me real focus on what I wanted to add to each page. This was also used to guide me through each step of the design giving me the chance to include everything I wanted without missing any feature out. I would highlight in a different colour each feature once it's completed to show what's left to finish.

### Skeleton Plane

* Once I finished laying out the structure, I then used the Balsamiq wireframes tool to complete detailed blueprints of all 5 pages across mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes. This helped me visualise what each page should look like and in turn create a good user experience for all site visitors. I decided to look at adding down arrows on the quiz page which makes this page easier for users to navigate from one question to the next. I also started to look at colour options and knew that I wanted to use teal and turquoise pallets as this would match the colour scheme associated to this football tournaments official website. More research in reference to colours would be done later on in the design process.

### Surface Plane

* With the Balsamiq blueprints completed and referencing the user stories, I created the website knowing how many pages was required, the layout of each page and what was important and achievable to include in the timescales I had to work with. For reference all 5 pages (homepage, tournament page, quiz page, answers page and feedback page) would have the same colour scheme, font styling, header layout and footer layout. The header includes a text logo and a navigation bar. The footer would include social media and copyright icons. 

* As my target audience would be mainly football fans from all around Europe, I wanted the site to have fresh appeal with eye catching images, useful information, a video clip central to the winning teams of each tournament, a quiz that users would enjoy and a feedback form that users can complete. All this I believe would not only give users a good experience now, they would also want to return to the site in the future as the site content, quiz questions and future tournament information would be added over time with potential new features I.e., live chat for interaction with other users, links to purchase merchandise and tickets and competitions available to enter.  

* To offer an attractive website for users to visit I decided to use the following fonts and colours 

    - Main header font: - 
    - Main header font size on mobile -  
    - Main header font size on tablet -  
    - Main header font size on desktop -  
 
    - Sub header font: -  
    - Sub header font size on mobile -  
    - Sub header font size on tablet -  
    - Sub header font size on desktop -  

    - Content font: - 
    - Content header font size on mobile -  
    - Content header font size on tablet -  
    - Content header font size on desktop - 

    - Colour scheme: - 
    - Header - 
    - body - 
    - Footer - 

* When starting the design of the website the first thing I wanted to do was set the default font style, font colours and background colours within the body element for all HTML pages. Full details can be found below for reference: - 

    - Font-family: Ubuntu - Sans-serif (fallback) will only be used if Ubuntu doesn't load) 
    - Font colour - 
    - Background Colour -

Welcome Liam Walsh,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
