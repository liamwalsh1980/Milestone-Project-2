## Bugs

* API key issues 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#api-not-activated-map-error

* Borders around quiz question images. Using the background size property with the cover value would cause an issue with the images on smaller screen sizes. I changed the value for all images from cover to contain which worked for what i wanted to acheieve which was to make sure that all of the image is shown on screen sizes. 

* On the feedback html page and within the form there was an issue with the content wasn't refreshing after the 'Leave feedback' submit button was clicked.
