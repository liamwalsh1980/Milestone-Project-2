1. I am an England Football fan. I have always followed England since I starting watching football as a young boy in the early 1980’s. I would like to know more about the tournament going back before I was born to get a better understanding of who hosted and who won the tournament. 

1. I’m a sports enthusiast and always enjoy being challenged when it comes to football knowledge.

My wife is from France and says that Football is the best sport on the planet. I would like to find out more about the tournaments connected with this sport and find out if football is the biggest and best sport on the planet as my Wife says. 

## Bugs

* API key issues 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#api-not-activated-map-error

* Borders around quiz question images. Using the background size property with the cover value would cause an issue with the images on smaller screen sizes. I changed the value for all images from cover to contain which worked for what i wanted to acheieve which was to make sure that all of the image is shown on screen sizes. 

* On the feedback html page and within the form there was an issue with the content wasn't refreshing after the 'Leave feedback' submit button was clicked.
