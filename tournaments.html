                    The 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as 2020 UEFA European
                    Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, or simply Euro 2020, is scheduled to be the 16th UEFA European
                    Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the
                    Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Please see a full list of cities hosting the Euro
                    2020.

                <p class="para-content">
                    The tournament, to be held in 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries, was originally scheduled from 12 June
                    to 12 July 2020. The tournament was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and rescheduled
                    for 11 June to 11 July 2021. The tournament will still retain the name "UEFA Euro 2020".

                    UEFA President Michel Platini said in 2012 that the tournament was to be hosted in several nations
                    as a "romantic" one-off event to celebrate the 60th "birthday" of the European Championship
                    competition. Having the largest capacity of any of the stadiums entered for the competition, Wembley
                    Stadium in London is scheduled to host the semi-finals and final for the second time, having done so
                    before at the 1996 tournament in the stadium's former incarnation. The Stadio Olimpico in Rome was
                    chosen to host the opening game, involving Turkey and hosts Italy. Originally to be played at 13
                    venues, two hosts were later removed: Brussels in December 2017 due to delays with the building of
                    the Eurostadium, and Dublin in April 2021 as there was no guarantee that spectators could attend.
                    Spain also changed their host city from Bilbao to Seville to allow an audience at matches.

                    Originally called the European Nations Cup, the first tournament in 1960 was held in France and the
                    games were shared between Paris and Marseille. Spain hosted the 1964 tournament with all the matches
                    shared between the Santiago Bernabeu and Camp Nou in Madrid and Barcelona respectively. In 1968 the
                    tournament became known as the European Championship and Italy hosted for the first time. Three
                    stadiums were used, the Stadio Olimpico (Rome), Stadio San Paolo (Naples) and the Stadio Communale
                    (Florence).

                <p class="para-content">
                    Belgium hosted in 1972 with two of the stadiums situated in Brussels, one in Antwerp and another in
                    Liege. The huge Eastern European country, Yugoslavia hosted the event in 1976 at the Red Star
                    Stadium in Belgrade, and the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb

                <p class="para-content">
                    In 1980 Italy was once again tasked with hosting only 12 years after doing so the first time. This
                    was the first edition to feature eight teams and as a result two new stadiums were used to host
                    games. The Stadio Olimpico and Stadio San Paolo were once again on display and the two new stadiums
                    were the San Siro and Stadio Communal in Turin. France hosted for a second time in 1984 and seven
                    different stadiums were used in seven different French cities. West Germany hosted for the first
                    time in 1988 in eight different stadiums, each of which had a capacity of more than 60,000.

                    The tournament headed to Sweden for the first time in 1992. Sweden used four stadiums each of which
                    was situated towards the south of the country. The 10th European Championships in 1996 were held in
                    England and 16 teams took part this time. The English beat out bids from Austria, Greece, the
                    Netherlands and Portugal.

                <p class="para-content">
                    For the first time the tournament was co-hosted by two countries in 2000 with Belgium and the
                    Netherlands sharing it. They beat bids from Spain and Austria to host the event. Eight different
                    stadiums were used for the matches in what many call the finest international tournament ever.
                    Again Austria bid this time alongside Hungary but they were beaten this time by Portugal to host
                    the tournament in 2004. The winning bid was selected in October 1999. After years of trying the
                    Austrians finally had a successful bid to host the tournament in 2008. It was a joint bid with
                    Switzerland who were also hosting the event for the first time.

                <p class="para-content">
                    In 2012 the tournament was again co-hosted this time between Poland and Ukraine.
                    Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, and Turkey had also put in bids but failed to win. France hosted
                    the tournament for a third time in 2016. Italy and Turkey also put in single bids while Norway
                    and Sweden put in a joint bid which was later withdrawn.
